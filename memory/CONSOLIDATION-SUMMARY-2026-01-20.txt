CONSOLIDATION FLOW COMPLETED
================================================================================

PHASE 1: ASTROCYTE FUNCTION (Memory Trace Formation)
-------------------------------------------------------
Input: UX Audit sprint with 48 broken elements, event delegation framework
Output: Raw session capture (262 lines)
File: memory/sessions/2026-01-20-ux-fixes-sprint-consolidation.md

Key Memories Captured:
1. Decision: Event delegation pattern over per-item listeners
2. Decision: Data attributes for feature flags and actions
3. Decision: Coming Soon modal for placeholder content
4. Decision: Unhide 8 courses with "Coming Soon" badges
5. Technical Insight: Event delegation scales infinitely (O(1) performance)
6. Technical Insight: Data attributes encode semantic behavior
7. Pattern Validation: Event delegation proven across 48 elements
8. Implementation: Single listener with closest() + switch routing

Emotional Salience Markers:
- User confidence: All 48 previously-broken elements now functional
- Strategic value: Framework scales to unlimited future items
- Architectural precedent: Differentiates from prior CSS-only patterns
- Enterprise readiness: Production-ready platform with polished UX


PHASE 2: OLIGODENDROCYTE FUNCTION (Progressive Consolidation)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Input: Raw session capture + existing CLAUDE.md patterns
Process: Identify consolidation targets, cross-reference existing knowledge, merge learnings
Output: Updated CLAUDE.md + new Pattern 12

Consolidation Actions:
1. Scanned existing patterns (1-11) for overlaps/connections
2. Identified event delegation as new pattern (not subsumed by existing 11)
3. Added UX Audit & Fixes Sprint to Development History (18 lines)
4. Created Pattern 12: Event Delegation for Multi-Item Features (19 lines + code)
5. Maintained cross-references (Pattern 12 links to 1, 5, 6, 11)

Result: CLAUDE.md expanded from 433 to 462 lines (remains efficient)

Pattern 12 Structure:
```
Pattern 12: Event Delegation for Multi-Item Features (Jan 20)
├─ Evidence: 48 non-functional elements fixed using single listener
├─ Implementation: Single body listener + data attributes + closest()
├─ Code Example: Full implementation template provided
├─ Performance: O(1) regardless of item count (scales to unlimited)
├─ Anti-Pattern: Individual listeners per item (doesn't scale)
└─ Application: Courses, tools, discussions, menus, all multi-item features
```

Development History Entry:
```
### UX Audit & Fixes Sprint (Completed - Jan 20, 2026)
- UX Audit: Identified 48 non-functional elements
- Event Delegation: Scalable handler routing framework
- Coming Soon Modal: Reusable placeholder component
- Page Handlers: All 48 elements wired across 6 pages
[continues with technical details]
```


PHASE 3: MICROGLIA FUNCTION (Pruning & Memory Health)
------------------------------------------------------
Input: All memory items (10 session files, CLAUDE.md, consolidation reports)
Process: Multi-stage tagging, protection signal verification, health check
Output: Memory system verified healthy, no pruning needed this cycle

Protection Signal Analysis:
- Items created <14 days ago: ALL PROTECTED (stabilization period)
- Items created 14-30 days ago: ELIGIBLE for #pruning-candidate tag
- Items created >30 days ago: ELIGIBLE for #review-needed escalation
- Items created >60 days ago: ELIGIBLE for archival

Current Status: All items <14 days old → 100% PROTECTED

Multi-Stage Tagging Applied:
- No items reach Day 30 threshold yet
- Next tagging cycle: 2026-01-31 (escalate oldest to Day 30)
- Next archival cycle: 2026-02-03 (archive items >60 days)

Memory Health Verified:
✓ No duplicates in CLAUDE.md
✓ Line count under 500 limit
✓ Recent items prioritized (January 20-19 at top)
✓ Temporal organization intact (oldest to newest flow)
✓ Cross-references valid (Pattern 12 links resolve)
✓ Session files discoverable (via Grep/Glob patterns)

Protection Status: MEMORY SYSTEM HEALTHY
