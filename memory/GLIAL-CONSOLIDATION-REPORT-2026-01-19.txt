NEXT ACTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Before Next Session):
  1. Complete Sprint 11: Settings pages + accessibility improvements
  2. During development: Validate tabbed UI pattern against WCAG 2.1 AA standards
  3. Monitor Pattern 9 implementation (accessibility compatibility critical)

SHORT-TERM (Within 3 Days):
  1. Collect feedback: Do users engage with "their" use case in tabbed demos?
  2. A/B test: Do quantified metrics increase perceived ROI vs. qualitative?
  3. Performance testing: Ensure 11-section module loads efficiently

MEDIUM-TERM (Within 30 Days):
  1. Promote Patterns 9-10 from "emerging" to "validated" if sustained across 2+ sections
  2. Archive Sprint 10 session files (memory/archived/2026-01/)
  3. Build Prompt Engineering Advanced (Sprint 13) using Context Engineering foundation
  4. Identify additional opportunities for quantified metrics pattern

LONG-TERM (Within 90 Days):
  1. Create tabbed interface component library documentation
  2. Build metrics template for enterprise content
  3. Consolidate 10+ sprints into high-level pattern reference
  4. Plan vertical-specific training modules (Sprint 15+)
