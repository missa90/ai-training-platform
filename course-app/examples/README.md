# Component Examples

This directory contains standalone HTML pages for testing and demonstrating individual components in isolation.

## Files

- `header-demo.html` - Interactive demo for the header component with controls for testing notifications, streaks, and keyboard shortcuts

## Usage

Open any `.html` file directly in a browser to test the component. These demos are for development purposes and are not part of the production build.

## Notes

- Demos may not include all styles from the main application
- Use these for quick component iteration before integrating into full pages
