# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains corporate AI training courses developed by [Intraverse AI](https://intraverseai.com/). The training materials address the gap in AI skills within enterprise environments.

### Key Differentiators
- **Custom client solutions**: Each training course is tailored to address specific client problems and use cases
- **Interactive animations**: Courses use dynamic, interactive web-based animations rather than static PowerPoint presentations
- **Hands-on engagement**: Focus on experiential learning over passive content consumption

## Architecture

*To be documented as the codebase develops. This section should describe:*
- *How training modules are structured*
- *The animation/interaction framework used*
- *Client customization patterns*
- *Content authoring workflow*

## Build & Development Commands

*To be added once the tech stack is established.*

## Content Guidelines

When developing training materials for this repository:
- Prioritize interactive elements that demonstrate AI concepts through hands-on experience
- Design for client customization - avoid hardcoding company-specific examples
- Ensure animations enhance understanding rather than distract from core concepts
